# iai-oop

iai-oop is an utility belt to deal with object declarations, in the context of OOP for javascript. It has been built on top of [the practical-inheritance module](https://npmjs.org/package/practical-inheritance). Please read the paper [*An alternative to the constructor pattern*](https://github.com/laconbass/practical-inheritance/blob/master/README.md) to further understanding of the practical inheritance pattern.


This module has been designed to be widely used within [iai](https://npmjs.org/search?q=iai) related modules.  It provides a chainable api that reduces the verbosity of vanilla javascript on defining object's properties and its attributes, plus some shortcut functions for OOP common operations.
