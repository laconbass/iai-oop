# iai-oop

iai-oop is an utility belt to deal with object declarations, in the context of OOP for javascript. It has been built on top of the [practical-inheritance module]. Please read the paper *[An alternative to the constructor pattern]* for further understanding of the practical inheritance pattern (aka *builder pattern*).

This module has been designed to be widely used within [iai modules]. It provides a chainable api that reduces the verbosity of vanilla javascript on defining object's properties and its attributes, plus some shortcut functions for OOP common operations.
